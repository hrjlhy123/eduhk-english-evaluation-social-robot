# EDU-english-evaluration Project

This project aims to develop a social robot in order to engage students in English stories during out-of-classroom English learning and hence improve their English language skills.  
The use of this robot is for out-of-classroom learning and to improve students’ English language skills by engaging them in interesting and graded stories. The robot is able to give feedback to students after they retell the story that they have just listened to.
